In this blog post, we will be discussing Vagrant, a powerful tool for managing virtual machines (VMs).
With Vagrant, you can easily spin up multiple VMs with just a few commands, making it perfect for testing
and development environments. We will demonstrate how to create a couple of VMs using VirtualBox as our
provider.

To follow along with this tutorial, you should have both Vagrant and VirtualBox installed on your system. If you haven't installed them yet, you can find the installation instructions here:

- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)


## Directory Structure

For this tutorial, we will be using the following directory structure:

```bash
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Vagrantfile
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ install_common.sh
```
The `Vagrantfile` is the main configuration file for Vagrant, and the `install_common.sh` file contains any additional setup. We will be using this file to install common packages on both the master and slave VMs.


### Vagrantfile
```ruby
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

# All Vagrant configuration is done below. The "2" in Vagrant.configure
# configures the configuration version (we support older styles for
# backwards compatibility). Please don't change it unless you know what
# you're doing.



# Configurable variables

## Common configuration

boxVersion = "ubuntu/focal64"

## Master Configuration

masterName = "dmaster"
masterIp = "192.168.56.10"
masterCpus = 2
masterMemory = 2048

## Node Configuration

numberOfNodes = 2
nodeNamePrefix = "dnode"
nodeIpPrefix = "192.168.56.1"
nodeCpus = 1
nodeMemory = 1024

# Main Script

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # master server
  config.vm.define masterName do |dmaster|
    dmaster.vm.box = boxVersion
    dmaster.vm.hostname = masterName
    dmaster.vm.box_url = boxVersion
    dmaster.vm.network :private_network, ip: masterIp
    dmaster.vm.provider :virtualbox do |v|
      v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--natdnshostresolver1", "on"]
      v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", masterMemory]
      v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--name", masterName]
      v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--cpus", masterCpus]
    end
    config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
      sed -i 's/ChallengeResponseAuthentication no/ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config    
      service ssh restart
    SHELL
    dmaster.vm.provision "shell", path: "install_common.sh"
  end

  (1..numberOfNodes).each do |i|
    nodeName = nodeNamePrefix + i.to_s
    nodeIp = nodeIpPrefix + i.to_s
    config.vm.define nodeName do |dnode|
      dnode.vm.box = boxVersion
      dnode.vm.hostname = nodeName
      dnode.vm.network "private_network", ip: nodeIp
      dnode.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
        v.name = nodeName
        v.memory = nodeMemory
        v.cpus = nodeCpus
      end
      config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
        sed -i 's/ChallengeResponseAuthentication no/ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config    
        service ssh restart
      SHELL
      dnode.vm.provision "shell", path: "install_common.sh"
    end
  end
end
```
This `Vagrantfile` will install and configure 1 Master VM and 2 Worker VMs.
Here's a breakdown of the `Vagrantfile`:

- The file starts by defining configurable variables, which allow you to customize the VM configurations,
such as the `VM's base box`, `CPU`, `memory`, and `IP address`.
- The `Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|` block is where the main configuration takes place.
- The master VM is defined with the name `dmaster`, and its settings are applied within the `config.vm.define 
masterName do |dmaster|` block.
- The worker VMs are created using a loop that iterates over the specified number of nodes (`numberOfNodes`). Each worker VM is assigned a unique name
and IP address based on the `nodeNamePrefix` and `nodeIpPrefix` variables.
- For each VM, the `box` version, `hostname`, and `network` settings are configured. Additionally, the provider-specific settings, such as `memory` and `CPU` 
allocation, are applied within the `dnode.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|` block.
- Lastly, a shell provisioner is used to update the `SSH` configuration to enable `ChallengeResponseAuthentication` and restart the `SSH` service.
The `install_common.sh` script is also executed, which you can customize to include any additional setup or installation steps.

### install_common.sh
```bash

#!/bin/bash

## install common 


HOSTNAME=$(hostname)
IP=$(hostname -I | awk '{print $2}')
echo "START - install common - "$IP

echo "Add host name for ip"
host_exist=$(cat /etc/hosts | grep -i "$IP" | wc -l)
if [ "$host_exist" == "0" ];then
echo "$IP $HOSTNAME " >/etc/hosts
fi


echo "END - install common - " $IP
```



## Creating the VMs
To create the VMs, follow these steps:

- Create a new directory for your project and place the `Vagrantfile` and the `install_common.sh` files in it.
- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `Vagrantfile`.
- Run the command `vagrant up`. Vagrant will download the required box (if not already cached) and create the master and worker VMs as specified in the `Vagrantfile`.

## Accessing the VMs
Once the VMs are up and running, you can access them using the  `ssh` command followed by the VM ip, for example:

- To access the master VM:  `ssh vagrant@192.168.56.10` (The default password is `vagrant`)
- To access the first worker VM:  `ssh vagrant@192.168.56.11` (The default password is also `vagrant`)
- You can also verify the status of your VMs by running the `vagrant status` command.
- You can stop the VMs by running the `vagrant halt` command.
- You can destroy the VMs by running the `vagrant destroy` command.

## Good Job! üçæ

In this blog post, we have demonstrated how to create multiple VMs using Vagrant and VirtualBox. By using a simple `Vagrantfile`, 
we can quickly create and manage VMs for testing and development purposes. Vagrant provides a powerful, flexible, 
and efficient way to manage your virtual environments.
